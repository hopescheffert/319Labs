<!-- we skipped that! -->

// REMAINING information about functions ---

// 1. self-invoke a function IIFE
(function (x, y) {console.log ("self-invoke: " + (x+y));})(100,200);

// in the above example, we had an anonymous function being called 
// right away. x gets 100 and y gets 200. 




// -----------------------------------------
// Understanding "this" and apply,call,and bind
// -----------------------------------------
// Functions are objects. They have a Call, Apply, and Bind method
// You can ask it to use a "this" TEMPORARILY using Call and Apply. 
// Only difference is in how they expect arguments
// Call  uses commas to separate arguments
// Apply just uses an array

// BIND binds a function to an object and returns the bound function.
// When the "bound" function is used, it always uses that object as this.

$(document).ready(function() {

// This is first object
var user = {
    data:[
      {name:"T. Woods", age:37},
      {name:"P. Mickelson", age:43}
    ],
    clickHandler:function (s) {
      console.log(arguments.length);
      if (arguments.length != 1) s = ":";
      try {
        console.log(s + this.data[0].name);
      }
      catch (err) {
        //$("#results").html("error reading data:" + this + "-" + err);
        console.log(s+"error reading data:" + this + "-" + err);
      }
    }
} // end of user


// This is second object
var user2 = {
    data:[
      {name:"Sam", age:37},
      {name:"Pam", age:43}
    ]
};

// 2. Note that the "this" is user here.
user.clickHandler("directly: calling user ");

// 3. See how call and apply are used.
// The only difference between call and apply is in how the arguments are
// being sent. In one case as comma-separated arguments and in the other
// case as an array containing the arguments.
// Note that the "this" is TEMPORARILY "user2" here.
user.clickHandler.call(user2, "call: user2 "); 
user.clickHandler.apply(user2,["apply: user2 "]);


// 4. Here is an example of how bind is used.
// The foo2 is a function that has user2 bound permanently to 
// the user.clickHandler function.
// Binding is often useful when assigning functions to event handlers.
var foo2 = user.clickHandler.bind(user2);
foo2("using bind: calling user's clickHandler but expecting user2 ");


// In this case, even though call is trying to set this for foo2 call to
// user - it maintains binding with user2. 
foo2.call(user, "using bind: calling user but expecting user2 ");


// 5. Here an event handler is assigned to paragraph with id p1.
// However, the goal is not met as the handler code actually uses 
// the PARAGRAPH object as "this" // object during runtime.
// <p id="p1"> How are you doing?  </p>
// clicking this will just give an error
$("#p1").click((function (s) { return function () {
user.clickHandler(s);};})("clicked p1 "));
// TRY IT OUT BY CLICKING P1!

// 6. If we really wanted to have "user" as the this for the handler,
// we can create a new function using bind that PERMANENTLY binds the 
// handler code to the this object.
// Binding is often useful when assigning functions to event handlers.
// <p id="p2"> Very well, Thank you!  </p>
// clicking on paragraph with id p2 will work.
// $("#p2").click((function (s,u) { return function () {
//user.clickHandler.bind(u)(s); }; })("clicked p2 ", user2));
$("#p2").click(foo2);
// TRY IT OUT BY CLICKING P2!

}); // end of ready
