	-push all 26 (random) cards to each Queue 
	
	
------	
Rules:
------

	-two players (assume one player and one "computer")
	-each player lays their card face up at the same time
		-person with higher card rank (highest is Ace, lowest is 2) wins that turn
			-whoever "wins" that turn takes both of the cards just played and puts them at the 
			 bottom of their stack
			
				-if cards are of same rank: WAR!
					-both players lay one card face down and one card face up
					-the player with the higher card will take both piles (6 total cards)
					
						-if this happens again, both players again lay one card face down and one card face up
							-player with the higher card will take both piles (now 10 cards)
							
	***If you don't have enough cards to complete the war, you lose. If neither player has enough cards, the one who runs out first loses

	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1590247/how-do-you-implement-a-stack-and-a-queue-in-javascript
	-each time the user lays their card down, the array pops that card off
		-whoever wins the turn pushes those cards in their array (at the bottom)
	
	-needs to keep score in some kind of div element at the top right corner - updates every time the 
	 card is laid down - game is over when one player has all 52 cards
